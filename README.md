## Developer Mode

**Developer Mode:** Enable developer mode on connected iOS devices.

They've made it harder to enable Developer Mode, but GeoPort handles it with ease. If you don't have Developer Mode enabled on your iOS device - you will need to temporarily remove your passcode to allow GeoPort to enable Developer Mode (Don't worry, GeoPort will let you know when running the app)

## Prerequisites

An iOS device and a sense of adventure!
*That's Right* - you do not need to install complex apps like python for **GeoPort** to work

**Windows Users**
You will need to install iTunes (we need their USB service so we can discover the iOS device!)

## Installation

- [Download](https://github.com/davesc63/GeoPort/releases/) the package for your operating system
- Run the application
- Explore the world and **Simulate Location**

## Running from source

Prefer to run the code yourself (or contribute)? The source is fully
functional and tracks the release behaviour:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davesc63/GeoPort.git
cd GeoPort
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

**Python 3.10 – 3.12 required** (3.13 is not supported yet: the `lzfse` C
extension has no cp313 Windows wheel). On Windows, double-click **`GeoPort.bat`** for the one-click experience:
if GeoPort is already running it just reopens the browser; otherwise one
UAC prompt starts it with no console window (a map-pin tray icon appears
and your browser opens when ready). `start.ps1` does the same from a
terminal (it creates `.\.venv` on first run, using `uv` if you have it).

The web UI opens at `http://localhost:54321` (a random high port is used if
that one is busy). A few extra switches are available:

- `--no-browser` - don't auto-open the browser
- `--port <n>` - pick the web port
- `--wifihost <ip>` / `--udid <udid>` - target a specific device over Wi-Fi
- `--restart-remoted` - stop/restart the Apple `remoted` service around
  tunnels on macOS. **Off by default** because it can break Xcode's device
  connection (issue #44).

> **Tip (issue #44):** if you also use Xcode to deploy to the same iPhone,
> leave `--restart-remoted` off. Disconnecting from GeoPort now releases the
> tunnel cleanly so Xcode can connect again.

### Features in the source build beyond the release exe

- **Server-side route/GPX playback** - the Play button now sends the route to
  the server, which walks it at the selected speed (walk/run/ride/drive) with
  one tunnel session for the whole route. Pause holds the last point; Stop
  clears the device location. Progress: `/route_status`.
- **Refresh-proof state** - refreshing the page keeps the connection, the
  simulated location (marker + coordinates) and the spoof buttons. A
  "connection lost" banner with one-click reconnect appears if the tunnel
  drops.
- **Saved location presets** - the Save button next to the location field
  stores names in `~/.geoport/locations.json`; the dropdown loads them.
- **Live activity log** - expand "Activity log" at the bottom of the page to
  tail `GeoPort.log` in the browser.
- **Dark mode is the default** (your choice is remembered).
- **System tray icon** - a map-pin in the notification area shows live
  status (connected / spoofing / walking route), with *Open GeoPort* and
  *Quit* (best effort: `pystray` is optional at runtime).
- **No telemetry** - the `api.geoport.me` phone-home calls are gone.
- **Localhost-only + optional API token** - the app binds to 127.0.0.1 (the
  old build listened on 0.0.0.0 with the debug console enabled). Set the
  `GEOPORT_TOKEN` env var to require a token on mutating API calls.
- **API + tests** - see `API.md` for the full HTTP API (drive it from
  scripts/Shortcuts) and `tests/test_smoke.py` (run with `pytest`).

## App Notes
- iOS 17 & iOS 18 are supported on both Windows and Mac
- Administrator / Sudo permissions are required for iOS17
- If you forget to reset your location when you disconnect, Don't worry! Simply connect your device again and "Stop Location"

## Tech Stuff and recognition
GeoPort is built with python, flask and pymobiledevice3
Interface inspired by the popular iFakeLocation, GeoPort is built for familiarity with the addition of iOS17 and Windows support (Windows release imminent)
